I have recently been made aware that MaxTo was featured on Download.com, and wrapped in horrible crapware that I have no desire for my software to be associated with. There have been (quite)[http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DownloadWrappersAndUnwantedSoftwareArePureEvil.aspx] (a bit)[http://www.ghacks.net/2011/08/17/the-cnet-download-com-installer/] of writing about this when they started doing it.

I have known about Download.com's policies for quite a while, and while I personally have been avoiding it, I was unaware that MaxTo was being offered there. I have now sent in a support request to have MaxTo removed from their site effective immediately. Let's see how long it takes for them to remove it.

Bundling software with crapware is a horrible practice, and I am quite frankly mad that Download.com does this without my permission. I've searched my e-mail archives and they have never notified me they were doing this.

**Update** Two hours later I got a reply from their support, confirming they have disabled the CNet Installer for my company account. So it look like MaxTo won't need to be removed anyway. I wish most publishers would contact them regarding this.
