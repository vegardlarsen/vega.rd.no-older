I've tried a few times to keep a blog here, and it has been at least 6 months since the last attempt. This time, I am going with Jekyll with the [Balzac theme](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll), a typographically excellent theme made by Cole Townsend.

I will probably revert to not updating this blog much, but I needed something on my domain name. So, here goes nothing.
