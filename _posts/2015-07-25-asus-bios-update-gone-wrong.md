I updated my ASUS UX301LAA BIOS today to get my external monitors working again with Windows 10. When I rebooted after flashing, the machine went straight back to the BIOS.

Long story short, if you find yourself in this situation, disable "Secure boot" and turn on "CSM". I don't know why, but it worked.
