I have had plenty of tries at writing an "about me"-page. I just never seem to make it as interesting or funny as I'd like.

When I was 8, I read my first programming book. It was on `BASIC`, and I seem to remember it took me a year from reading that book until I actually tried programming on a computer for the first time. Since then, I've graduated through Turbo Pascal, Visual Basic, Delphi, PHP, C/C++ and C# &mdash; just to name the few I felt I got a hang of.

In between I've gotten a Master's degree in Computer Science from NTNU, where [my thesis](http://daim.idi.ntnu.no/masteroppgaver/004/4014/masteroppgave.pdf) was about audio fingerprinting.

At my day-job[^1] I am a co-founder, co-owner and CTO of [Digital Creations AS](http://www.digitalcreations.no). We do everything from developing software and services which we sell directly to end users, through developing custom websites for clients. We even have a little side-gig with drone photography and filming.
